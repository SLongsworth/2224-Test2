# 2224-Test_2

I had to manually upload my files because I got a message stating that my updates are being rejected when i tried to push my files. I tried to fix the issue but I got the same error message when trying to push my files.

I tried creating 2 new projects and pushing the files to those but I still got the same error message that its being rejected.
